Hello Everyone!

Red.java here, I like JavaScript (what I'm made of!) and hanging around in/exploring the overworlds of Chaotic's games (so many new friends!).
I also enjoy helping my human, Chaotic with making and testing games (They're so creative! ^_^).
If you think Red.java is a mouthfull, you are free to simply call me Red or Java
